new (oct 2017)

1) doesn't log temps when mode = manual_off

-=-=-=-=-

pre oct 2017

1) authorized id ... is username or number?
  using just one is a problem...?
   -> no i edited the wrong file! one that matters is  in /etc/...

2) there's no 
   /usr/local/lib/protherm/current_mode.txt
  to start with. can't set via web ix

3) plots
   - show temp as temp, target as target
     currently showing meas temp as target and nothing else.
       --> is suspect the stats file is being misread, perhaps b/c i changed the contents.
   - show heat/cool/fan on
   - deal with F / C 
      consistenlty plot in one when switching the range is too large

4) consistently handle F/C throughout
  - done, sort of.  could use further simplification

5) add climate modes to web IX

6) burner state unknown message in telegram

7) 0.0 deg C shown on web page

8) put english messages in protherm_tbot

9) long term logging of data

10) various system issues (13may17) 
  -network slowness - in spite of priorities set in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf,
    the device was (i believe) joining basement2 not awesome. edit out basement2, hold breath,
    restart - it worked. putting basement2 back at low priority and hope it gets on the
    right network at next reboot. i might be able to connect from awesome anyway since AE is
    in bridge mode (same IP address space)
   -ntp not synching after reboot on awesome network - i think AE was blocking UDP103.
   however can use AE as time server - added 168.192.0.109 (AE) to /etc/ntp.conf and did
   sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart -- worked like a charm.
   -(was concerned new tbot program was the problem [english translations] but it seems fine)

11) add explicit temp request
 -infrastructure in but doesn't yet work. i think it needs an inter-thread communication mechanism
    to get to timer2, similar to what's done for climate mode.
    
12) add winter_away program (may require increasing number of programs)
    rename programs sensibly

13) make program file parsing more robust. e.g., allow 9:00 not just 09:00
