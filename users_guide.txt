trouble with NTP
1) change pool servers in /etc/ntp.conf
2) ntpd is still not synching up properly at boot. to do it manually do this
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart

changing wireless networks
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

to check: ntpstat 
  (needed to be installed: sudo apt-get install ntpstat)
